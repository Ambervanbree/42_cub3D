Hi hi!!

So I did not have the best day today. It's a shame. 

I first tried to fix the fish eye effect and it took me FOREVER,
but I didn't manage. So I commented everything and gave up. 

Then I tried to draw an image with the walls and then display
it all in once, in stead of looping continuously. Like this
we can draw an image that has both the 2D and the 3D view.
This sort of worked, but there's still errors. It bugs 
when we walk into a wall for example. I have kept the old 
way of displaying in game_prev.c and the new is now in game.c.
It's a bit of a mess, sorry for that. 

And I really wanted to have a look at reversing the textures
into the walls, but I spent to much time on trying to make
things work that wouldn't :(. I'm really disappointed about
this stupid day. I do have an idea of how it works, however.

HAVE A GOOD DAY TODAY and hopefully Tuesday I can be of better use.

UPDATE: I suddenly figured out what I did wrong all day and
I have written the fish eye correction and the function to
get the right wall texture (in calc_utils.c). Butttt I'm not
sure if it works because MLX doesn't work on my laptop at home.

Ok, see you Tuesday!!
