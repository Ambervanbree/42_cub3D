Hi hi!!

So I did not have the best day today. It's a shame. 

I first tried to fix the fish eye effect and it took me FOREVER,
but I didn't manage. So I commented everything and gave up. 
My idea is that if we have a certain angle the sdX and sdY
are going to be the cos(angle) or the sin(angle) * themselves.
But I don't manage to find in which situation it's which. 
And we're going to need this to find the right textures too.

Then I tried to draw an image with the walls and then display
it all in once, in stead of looping continuously. I think this
is important, because it already happened that my screen was 
stuck when I tried to turn both windows. This sort of worked, 
but there's still some errors. It bugs when we walk into a wall
for example. I have kept the old way of displaying in game_prev.c
and the new is now in game.c.

And I really wanted to have a look at reversing the textures
into the walls, but I spent to much time on trying to make
things work that wouldn't :(. I'm really disappointed about
this stupid day.

HAVE A GOOD DAY TODAY and hopefully Tuesday I can be of better use.
