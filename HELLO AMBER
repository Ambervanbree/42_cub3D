Hello!

I am happy to tell you that it looks like 3D's working.
The fish-eye effect still needs to be fixed.

I worked pretty nastily though, I left the 2D map on the side and focused on 3D.
Plus I focused on "working" but I did not really think clean nor clever coding.
I will cleanup on Monday.

I left some notes in the calculations file so it's easier to understand. I fixed
some variables pretty arbitrarily so feel free to optimize if you find something 
unclear or unlogical.

Don't know why I typed all this in english.

Have a great week-end and trip to Disneyland with your notputtingthekeysinthedrawer
